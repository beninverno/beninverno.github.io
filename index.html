    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started as a child. I’ve been using the computer ever since i can remember. When i was a young child, i used to draw pictures of houses on MSPaint and play Pinball. This gradually progressed with the main theme of my interest in computers being related to playing games. I’ve always felt that i’ve had a natural affinity with computers (and my family would seem to agree with the amount they ask me for help). My main experience with computer has just been from myself and helping family. One of my proudest moments has been building computers from scratch, building my first PC in 2013 with money from my first job, and then building another last year.
    </p><p>    I chose to come to RMIT because i’ve always wanted to come to this university, ever since I came to the university for open day. I’ve heard good things about the course and the way IT is handled in general at RMIT, which based my decision to come here to study.
        </p><p>I expect to learn how an IT system runs and how to best maintain it. I also hope to learn a bit of networking, and a bit of coding as well.

    <h2>Ideal job</h2>

    <br><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/36804181?type=standout">Job Link</a>
    <p>This position is for a job as a Cloud Architect with a company based in Canberra. The job entails designing and implementing cloud solutions for clients. I believe this is a good job for me because i am very interested in Cloud Technology and the way it works, it also gives me the opportunity to work with something consistent (cloud and developing cloud) while making it different for clients so that the work doesn’t get stale. 
        </p><p>The requirements for this job are:
            <ul><li>Ability to provide monetary information about the cloud to the sales team</li>
                <li>Designing and pricing of a cloud system
                <li>Delivering a project with design, implementation and architecture
                <li> Deliver projects to customer satisfaction and in alignment to the company
                <li>Work well in a team</ul>
            Skills that I currently have:
            <ul><li>Work well in a team</li></ul>
            How will I gain these skills over time?
            <ul><li>I will gain these skills over time primarily through my course at university. Since this is not a graduate job, some of these skills (specifically related to the cloud) is something that I could learn in my first job out of university. Alternatively, there are some courses you can take online that teach you about both the Google Cloud and the Amazon Web Services cloud, that i could take that would make it easier for me to get my foot in the door in the Cloud industry.</li></ul>
            </p>
    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <p><b>Myers Briggs: </b>INFP-T<br>
    <b>Learning Style: </b>Visual / Tactile Learner<br>
    <b>Creativity Test: </b>Creative Score of 47.28</p>
    <p><b>What does the result of these tests mean to you?</b>
    <ul><li>I think these tests just confirm what i know. The myers briggs test result is something i expected, because i know that’s how i am. I was surprised at how accurate the description of this personality type is. The learning style test was very balanced between the three learning styles (30/35/35 split) which i think is accurate, i feel like i can learn in a variety of different ways and there is not one specific way in which i learn. The creativity score i think is a bit inaccurate, i feel like it is hard to judge creativity. I feel like i’m definitely a creative person, but maybe in a different way to the norm.</li></ul></p>
    <p><b>How do these results change the way you behave in a team?</b>
    <ul><li>I feel like these results don’t really change the way i behave in the team. The myers-briggs test does say that i am Introverted, but i feel that despite this, i can still function very well in a team. I feel like i can cooperate will in a team and these results don’t really change that perception.</li></ul></p>
    <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
    <ul><li>I think that i just need to be aware of my personality and insure that my introversion and the way i behave does not get in the way of how i work with others. Perhaps trying to form a group with people whose personalities complement mine would help my productivity and effectiveness in a team.</li></ul></p>
    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>My project idea is to create a long, transparent tube filled with LED lights that are to be controlled by some sort of microcomputer (most likely an Arduino, but maybe a Raspberry Pi). I hope to maybe include some sort of easy way to control it as well, perhaps using buttons to change the color or pattern that the LED’s display the color. Once programmed, i will lay the tube around the bottom edges of the room and plug it in, and hopefully it will be able to light it up with some cool colors!</p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>I’ve always wanted to work with a micro-computer (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to create something. I’ve had some experience with coding so I believe this will be the next step in getting better with coding. I wanted to do lights because my study where my computer is and where i do all my studying is very empty at the moment (the only furniture inside is a desk) and i feel like adding some lights in will make it look much cooler and maybe distract people from the fact that the room is very empty. Another reason i want to do this is so i can prove to myself that i can make something and that i am not bad at coding!</p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Firstly, i will need to purchase an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. It is most likely cheapest for me to get this off Ebay, and get it delivered to my house. I will definitely need to familiarise myself with the micro-computer that i choose. I have never worked with a micro-computer before and i’m not even sure what language they run in, so it will definitely be necessary to learn the basics before i get into the nitty-gritty of the project.

            After i’ve familiarised myself with the basics of the micro-computer, i can begin to figure out what lights i need to work with the micro-computer. My idea is to purchase a large, transparent tube made of some sort of plastic. It needs to be malleable so i can lay it around the base of the bedroom like a chord. I will need to do some research in order to figure out what kind of lights i need. For this to work, i will need a very large amount of LED’s set up in a line one after the other. As well as this, they will need to have the ability to be programmed into different colors, as well as turn on and off in different ways (dim in and out, not just turn straight on and off).
            
            After i have figured this out, i need to put the LED’s in the tube. This will need to be done carefully in order not to break the lights. It may be required for me to do some programming to figure out if the lights can handle everything.
            
            After the physical side has been set up, i will need to begin coding. This will most likely be the hardest part. Fortunately, there is a plethora of online tools that can assist me in the coding and i can always get help. I think it will be initially not too hard to turn them on and get them to go a certain color, but it may prove to be difficult to program the lights to change color and dim in and out and stuff like that.
            
            If i can find buttons, i will try to program the buttons to change the color / intensity. This is an optional part, because i am not too sure where i can get buttons from and how difficult it would be to program. I will keep this as an optional part for the project.
            
            Once i have everything working and the code is all done, i need to connect the lights to the micro-computer and make sure that everything works as intended. After this, all i need to do is lay the lights around in the room and turn it on, and hopefully it will work as intended!
            </p>
    <h4>Tools / Technologies</h4>
    <p>For this project, i will need to have a micro-computer in order to control the lights. I will most likely go with an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi, because they are both very cheap and relatively easy to pick up with lots of online support. I will need LED lights that are programmable (not sure if they can all be programmable, will have to research) and also have the ability to change colors. Lastly, i will need some sort of plastic tube to place the LED lights in so i can protect it and lay it out across a room.</p>
    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
    <p>There are a few skills that are required for this project. The main one is coding. I do have some experience with some languages, so the coding portion of this project shouldn’t be overly difficult. I can always google if i struggle. There may also be a little bit of electrical work required to get the lights to work as intended, which may be tough because i have no experience in electronics.</p>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>If the project works out and performs as intended, this will solve the problem of lack of lighting in my study. No longer will i have to sit in the dark staring at the computer screen.</p>
